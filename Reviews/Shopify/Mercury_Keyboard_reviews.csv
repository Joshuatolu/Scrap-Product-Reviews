This keyboard was worth every PENNY, absolutely love it. Especially the different light patterns and how nice the feel is when you click each key. I got the red metallic esc key cap and it adds a nice contrast. This keyboard looks so sleek and nice. I‚Äôve never had a 65% keyboard so it‚Äôs taken some getting used to but i have zero regrets. Will definitely order more from them in the future.

I think i might have found a new hobby in keyboards!"

I live in Sweden so it cost me around $180 but it worth every single penny. The service was great too as they promised, I ordered it on 13th of April and received it on 3rd May.

William ," April 16, 2023",Rating: 5,Easily the best keyboard I've ever owned.,"This is the 3rd keyboard I've bought and it is easily the best one yet. I've heard people say this keyboard is a glorified GK64. My first keyboard was a GK64 and that could not be further from the truth. The quality really does speak for itself once you have the board in hand, and typing on it feels incredible. You can tell effort was put into properly lubing the switches and the stabilizers are perfect. No rattle, and you really do get a nice THOCKY sound. If you're looking for a compact keyboard for gaming and typing, I would definitely recommend this if you aren't trying to build your own custom setup. This is about as good as it gets when it comes the prebuilts!"

Dermot ," April 10, 2023",Rating: 4,Even better than expected,This was a huge hit for my son for his birthday! Quicker shipping than expected and came in time for his birthday! Very quiet keyboard- my other two boys are envious of the new keyboard and think its super cool- would definitely buy again- the only slight negative is how expensive it is...very pricey for a keyboard and the shipping cost was expensive as well....

Eman ," March 28, 2023",Rating: 5,Europe Users Review,"I am just getting into the costume keyboard game and didn't want to assemble one myself due to time constraint but still wanted something that could match it stock and I hit the jackpot. The Snowstone not only looks but feels like a premium keyboard, even though it has a US layout which means its missing a couple of keys/reorganized. Although it can be annoying at times, you quickly get used to it. I use the keyboard for mainly gaming and school work. How I worked around the US layout is that I just set the windows keyboard settings to (in my case Sweden) layout and it works just like intended. 

My friends come over to just feel in in person. Its just an awesome experience."
Leonardo ," March 27, 2023",Rating: 5,AMAZING KEYBOARD!,"This keyboard works great! I‚Äôve used a fair share of keyboards throughout my life and not a single one has felt as great as the Snowstone! The compact size really helped de-clutter my desk and the clicky keys sound so satisfying. Whether you‚Äôre in the market for a gaming keyboard to play games like Valorant and Apex or you‚Äôre just looking for an appealing, compact keyboard for your workspace, I highly recommend the Snowstone or any other HIGROUND product. Amazing quality!"

Joshua ," March 8, 2023",Rating: 5,,Was skeptical because of the high praise Nadeshot was giving since he is partnered with them. This is a custom keyboard for lazy people who don‚Äôt want to build and do research themselves. 5/5 and I‚Äôll definitely be buying more from them in the future.
Coby ," March 7, 2023",Rating: 5,Best stock keyboard I‚Äôve bought,This keyboard seriously sounds just like the demonstration video on its webpage.

Justin ," March 10, 2023",Rating: 3,There are brown marks on the outer shell of the keyboard,"I don‚Äôt know if these marks are a part of a manufacturing error but I cant seem to get it off, even with isopropyl alcohol, and it‚Äôs really bothering especially because of how visible it is on the clear white casing.

Derek ," January 31, 2023",Rating: 5,This keyboard is worth every penny!,"I have been piecing together everything I need for a gaming setup, and one of the most crucial parts in my opinion is a good keyboard. 

After doing some extensive research, I decided I wanted to go down the mechanical keyboard route. And although I never owned one prior to purchasing this, I decided to take a leap of faith.

Let me tell you this keyboard has such a premium feel to it and sounds phenomenal. I will definitely be purchasing from Higround again in the future!"
Collin ," January 31, 2023",Rating: 5,I might be a bit biased...,"So the first thing I did when I saw this keyboard was gasp. I for one am new to keyboards as I only have a G Skill full rgb keyboard prior, which was a hand-me-down from my uncle. I looked into various articles, youtube videos and saw the overall controvery whirling around the brand. People throwing out names like Keychron, Tofu keyboards and so forth. But the sound, and designs...

The appearance of this keyboard was amazing, and I knew I had to buy it. 

It did take awhile to ship. I wish there were ways to actually have it ship much faster and sooner. But as soon as the keyboard arrived into my hands; I was downright ecstatic!

I know the Higround brand is overall pricey and controversial; but the keyboard is really high quality. It sounds great, feels durably and not like plastic, but it also comes with various rgb options which I don't really care about. The tools it came with like the switch remover and keycap puller is a definite good start at getting into keyboards! I will say that contrary to many reviews, the switch puller is not at all hard to use and the keyboard itself is great. Overall the keys have a tiny bit of resistance. But it's super easy to press and the sounds make it all the more satisfying. It makes doing homework and chatting much more relaxing and overall fun! Of course if you're not into the sound that the white flame switches bring to the table, or the design of the keycaps then this is not the keyboard for you. Overall; the keycap's price is 50$ USD, which means I'm paying 85 dollars for the base, switches and rgb and so forth. So if you don't like the switches or keycaps design; then sure buy a different keyboard. But if your here for the design and overall amazing sound that I think the white flame switches provide; this is the keyboard for you."

Jacob ," December 8, 2022",Rating: 5,Highest of quality,i am coming off a logitech and matrix keyboard both of which were good but the quality of this keyboard is insane the keys on every other i have tried have felt very mass produced and like cheap plastic (that‚Äôs obvious but you get what i mean) whereas these keys feel extremely well made and a much higher quality and the lighting color range and presets are so cool and unique they have you‚Äôre basic colors and every shade in between involved
Connor ," December 6, 2022",Rating: 5,Beautifully Built,The only complaint i can find about this keyboard is the absence of the F keys (only because that's an inventory button of mine hehe). But I'm sure I will survive due to impeccably smooth keystrokes and seemingly optimal responsiveness. Also can not say enough about the simple yet well designed art of the keyboard. All in all I am a novice user as of yet but this is my favorite peripheral purchase so far!

The casing has good weight and the inside contains a silicon dampening sheet, the RGB also glows well through the semi-transparent shell. The key caps feel thick and I love the pattern and side printing. The switches feel well lubed and have a good, creamy pop sound. I'm especially impressed with the stabilizers, there's almost 0 rattling anywhere on the board and that's a tall task with a space bar. I don't even think I have any additions I would add to this board, 10/10."

Won't be hot-swapping this board for a while, if at all, because the switches are super smooth and soft to type on, they are currently my personal favorite.
The RGB is a really cool touch too and there are plenty of modes and colors to choose from.
Overall, this board needs no modifications whatsoever as it already sounds great right out of the box, and looks great too. Thank you Higround!"

The switches on this keyboard sound absolutely amazing, and feel great. Not to mention the amazing design and RGB lighting options. When ordering, I was a bit skeptical on the letter symbols being on the sides of the keycaps as apposed to on top. However, when you have the keyboard on your desk you can see the letters and symbols perfectly. Overall, a great keyboard and most definitely can't beat the price."

Danny ," September 23, 2022",Rating: 5,"First ""real"" keyboard",This Higround board was the first time I bought a keyboard that wasn't from a gaming brand like Razer or Logitech and I cannot believe I waited this long to buy one. The lubed switches sound great and the keycaps are a perfect texture for typing and gaming. This is the best feeling keyboard ever and it has definitely gotten me into building keyboards as well.
