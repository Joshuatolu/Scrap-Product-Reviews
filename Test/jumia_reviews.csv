The phone is so beautiful and it's features are amazing.
The Bluetooth that came with it is also lovely cos it gives professional vibe. Just ensure you keep the middle button on it on till you hear connected, sane way you connect Bluetooth to your phone is how to go about it.

In summary, the phone is more than the price.

So far you can add any other app or features you like to the phone, you'll definitely enjoy it.

The headphone that came with it is extremely nice cos it gives your music a very professional beat. For those saying they're unable to use it, it's very simple. Just on your Bluetooth and press the O button, while at it pit it in your ear as you press the button till you hear Bluetooth connected once you pair it with your phone.

Mind you, you can use the Bluetooth with any other phone or device.
In summary, this phone is worth more than the price. I pray it last cos this review is based on 24hrs usage."

It has only vibrate then ring feature...in Which the phone vibrates a little and starts ringing, u can be in a noise area and it in ur pocket ringing and you will miss alot of calls... Not suitable for people in factories and constructions... Battery life is good and radio is good, good design... I think it will be durable..."
